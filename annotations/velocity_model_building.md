#### Seismic inverse problems
"*Seismic inverse problems can be divided into two main categories: 1) **estimating an Earth model from recorded seismic
data**, also known as seismic inversion, **which is the main focus
of this article**, and 2) seismic signal restoration and enhancement, such as denoising, imputation, and bandwidth expansion, which are typically performed in a preliminary stage
previous to further seismic inversion and other geophysical analyses.*"

Focus on the problems:
- tomography,
- FWI,
- MS-FWI (Multiscale FWI),
- Reflectivity and impedance model building.
