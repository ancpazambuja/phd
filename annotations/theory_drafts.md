## Random Variables
A random variable is a collection of outcomes from an experiment run several times and have a stochastic behaviour. 

A random variable X can be defined by enumeration: 

X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, ..., xN} from which we can build histograms. In this context,
we can define: 


as a collection
Two main views

### Classical
Equiprobable outcomes -> Pr(/omega /in /Omega) = frac{1,#/Omega}

### Frequentist
F(x) -> Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

and

f(x) = F'(x) -> Probability Density Function (PDF)

or 

p(x) -> Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Pr(X)

#### Note
Frequentist Probability may also be describe as:

Pr(A) =
