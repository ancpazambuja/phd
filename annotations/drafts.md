# Perceptron

## Definition
In machine learning, the perceptron (or McCullochâ€“Pitts neuron) is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.

$$f(x) = \theta(w.x + b)$$

where:
 - $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$
 - $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
 - $b \in \mathbb{R}$
 - $\theta$ can be any activation function

## History

### McCulloch-Pitts

**1943 - A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity**

It the was the first computational model of the neuron and allowed the establishment of a conceptual connection between the neuron and propositional logic.

It was the basis of the Rosenblatt's Perceptron.
